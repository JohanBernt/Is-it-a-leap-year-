# Is-it-a-leap-year-
Using javascript functions, I created a calculator to determine whether a year is a leap year.

The rules for determining a leap year are as follows:
A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4;
Except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;
Unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.
